# Getting started

This getting started guide will show you all you need to know in order to create a simple CloudFront Function
which adds an HTTP header to an incoming request using the cf-functions library.

### Pre-requisites

If you haven't already, complete the steps in [setup](./setup.mdx).

## Step 1: Create config file

In the root directory of the project create a file named `cf-functions.ts`.
This file contains function [configuration](./usage/configuration) and deployment information.

```typescript
// cf-functions.ts

import { Config, DistributionEventType } from "cf-functions";

const config: Config = {
  defaultRuntime: "cloudfront-js-1.0",
  functions: {
    AddHeader: {
      handler: "/handler.ts",
      test: "/test.ts",
      description:
        "Adds the x-custom-header HTTP header to request.",
      associations: [
        {
          distributionId: "MYDISTID",
          eventType: DistributionEventType.VIEWER_REQUEST,
          behaviourPattern: "default",
        },
      ],
    },
  },
};

export default config;
```

The above config outlines instructions for cf-functions to create a function named `AddHeader` that runs on the `cloudfront-js-1.0`
runtime, executing on [viewer request](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/associate-function.html),
which is associated with a CloudFront Distribution `MYDISTIS` on the `default` behaviour.

## Step 2: Create function handler

Create a file matching the handler file path for the `AddHeader` function supplied in the config above: `handler.ts`.

```typescript
// handler.ts

import { FunctionEvent, HandlerReturn } from "cf-functions";

function handler(event: FunctionEvent): HandlerReturn {
    var headers = event.request.headers;

    headers["x-custom-header"] = { value: "Cool beans!" };

    return event.request;
}
```

The handler code above simply adds a header named `x-custom-header` to the viewer request with a value of `Cool beans!`.
For more information related to writing function code, refer to the AWS [programming model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/writing-function-code.html)
docs.

## Step 3: Create handler tests

Create a file matching the [handler test](./usage/testing) file path for the `AddHeader` function supplied in the config above: `test.ts`.

```typescript
// test.ts

export default [
    {
        name: `It should add x-custom-header with value 'Cool beans!'.`,
        given: {
            request: {
                method: "GET",
                uri: "https://mysite.com",
            },
        },
        expect: {
            request: {
                method: "GET",
                uri: "https://mysite.com",
                headers: {
                    "x-custom-header": {
                        value: "Cool beans!",
                    },
                },
            },
        },
    }
]
```

A test file expects a default export consisting of an array of test objects. Learn more about how function tests work
in the [testing](./usage/testing) section.

## Step 4: Deploy to AWS

Deploying a function involves using the following CLI commands. Based on your desired workflow and CI/CD setup, you may
not need them all.

### Stage

The stage command deploys the handler code for each configured function to the AWS CloudFront Functions `DEVELOPMENT`
environment.

```shell
cf-functions stage
```

<video width={"100%"} controls>
    <source src="/cf-functions/video/stage-example.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

### Test

The test command runs the test suite associated with each configured function.

```shell
cf-functions test -s DEVELOPMENT
```

<video width={"100%"} controls>
    <source src="/cf-functions/video/test-example.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

### Publish

The publish command copies the handler code for each configured function from the `DEVELOPMENT` environment to the `LIVE`
environment.

```shell
cf-functions publish
```

<video width={"100%"} controls>
    <source src="/cf-functions/video/publish-example.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

### Associate

The associate command creates an association between a function deployed in the `LIVE` environment and an AWS CloudFront
Distribution behaviour, for each configured function.

```shell
cf-functions associate
```

<video width={"100%"} controls>
    <source src="/cf-functions/video/associate-example.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

:::note

It can take up to 5 minutes for the association to complete for the first time.
