# Setup

## Pre-requisites

The cf-functions CLI tool uses the AWS SDK and therefore requires [AWS account credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)
configured on the machine in use.

## Installation

```shell
yarn add --dev cf-functions ts-node typescript
```

## Configuration

### ESM

This package is [pure ESM](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c), meaning you must use
ESM when setting up your project too. Ensure the package.json in your project has `module` for type.

```json
// package.json

{
  "type": "module",
  ...
}
```

### Typescript

To allow ESM support, set the module to `NodeNext` as per below. It's also recommended to set the target to `es5` as that
is the closest Ecmascript version to the CloudFront JS runtime.

```json
// tsconfig.json

{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es5",
        "module": "NodeNext",
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```

### cf-functions.ts

A [configuration](./usage/configuration) file named `cf-functions.ts` containing project configuration is required. The
default location for the config file is the current working directory at runtime.
