# Testing

Writing tests is important for any code, however it's particularly important for CloudFront Functions given the vastly
[reduced functional capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/functions-javascript-runtime-features.html)
of the CloudFront JS runtime. Writing function tests ensures code meets the functional requirements it was written for,
but also that it's compatible with the CloudFront JS runtime.

A test file can be declared alongside a functions handler code via the [configuration file](./configuration) - refer to
the config docs for more information.

While it's highly recommended to include handler tests, it's not required. Simply exclude the `test` command from your
CI/CD workflow.

## Test File

A handler test file consists of an array of test case objects. The array must be the default export of the file. An
example test file is included below.

```typescript
// test.ts

export default [
    {
        name: `It should add x-custom-header with value 'Cool beans!'.`,
        given: {
            request: {
                method: "GET",
                uri: "https://mysite.com"
            },
        },
        expect: {
            request: {
                method: "GET",
                uri: "https://mysite.com",
                headers: {
                    "x-custom-header": {
                        value: "Cool beans!",
                    },
                },
            },
        },
    }
];
```

A test case object consists of the following properties. For those familiar with Jest, this should look somewhat familiar.
Use the full power of Typescript in generating test cases dynamically.

| Name   | Type   | Description                                                                                 |
|--------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name   | String | The name of the test case.                                                                  |
| given  | Object | A partial object imitating an incoming CloudFront request event.                            |
| expect | Object | An object imitating the resulting CloudFront request event after the function code has run. |

The object declared in `given` is merged with a [default request event](https://github.com/burketyler/cf-functions/blob/master/src/cli/commands/test/consts.ts)
to prevent test cases from needing to specify the entire object on every test case. Just override the fields related to
the test case with real values.

Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/functions-event-structure.html)
for more information relating to CloudFront event structures.

## Test Runner

CF-Functions includes a test runner compatible with the CloudFront test API, making it easy to create a test suite
and automate test runs during deployments.

Use the below command to run tests against a specific environment.

```shell
cf-functions test -s DEVELOPMENT
```

<video width={"100%"} controls>
    <source src="/cf-functions/video/test-example.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

Use `cf-functions help` for more information on commands.
