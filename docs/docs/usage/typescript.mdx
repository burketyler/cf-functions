# Typescript

The framework supports Typescript out of the box, no additional configuration required. This means the `cf-functions`
config file as well as any handler code or test files can all be `.ts` files.

A number of useful types related to CloudFront Functions have been included in this package. Check the `index.js` of this
package for a list of bundled types.

## Vanilla JS

If you prefer to use vanilla Javascript, this is also possible. Ensure that your `tsconfig.json` includes the `allowJs`
option.

```json
// tsconfig.json

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": true,
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```
