# Environment Variables

The framework uses [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to load environment variables at runtime. This is useful
in cases where you want to deploy your functions to different environments without changing code.

By default, the `.env` in the current working directory will be parsed (if it exists) when running any CLI command. The
path to the environment variable can be explicitly specified using the `-e {pathToFile]` argument with any command.

E.g.

```shell
cf-functions stage -e .env.production
```

Use `cf-functions help` for more information on commands.
