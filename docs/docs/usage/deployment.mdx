# Deployment

The framework parses the [configuration](./configuration) file for deployment mappings when using any of the below commands.
CloudFront Function deployments occur in four stages:

1. Stage function in the `DEVELOPMENT` environment.
2. Test function in the `DEVELOPMENT` environment.
3. Publish function to the `LIVE` environment.
4. Associate function with a CloudFront Distribution behaviour.

<div style={{marginTop: "50px", display: "flex", justifyContent: "center"}}>
    <a href={"/cf-functions/img/deploy-workflow.png"} target={"_blank"}>
        <img
            src={"/cf-functions/img/deploy-workflow.png"}
            alt={"Deployment workflow"}
        />
    </a>
</div>

## 1. Stage

Staging a function creates the function in CloudFront if it doesn't already exist, or updates the handler code
(only in the `DEVELOPMENT` environment) if it does exist.

Functions in the `DEVELOPMENT` environment cannot be associated with a distribution yet, but they can be tested. When
developing your function code, you can use the `stage` command to push it to AWS for [testing](./testing).

```shell
cf-functions stage
```

<video width={"100%"} controls>
    <source src="/cf-functions/video/stage-example.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

## 2. Test

Refer to the [testing](./testing) page for more information.

## 3. Publish

Publishing a function copies the function from the `DEVELOPMENT` environment to the `LIVE` environment. A function in the
`LIVE` environment can be tested and additionally associated with CloudFront Distribution behaviours.

When publishing a function to `LIVE`, any existing distribution associations will begin using the new version of the
function.

```shell
cf-functions publish
```

<video width={"100%"} controls>
    <source src="/cf-functions/video/publish-example.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

## 4. Associate

A function in the `LIVE` environment can be associated with a single or multiple CloudFront Distribution behaviour(s). Once
an association is made, on either `viewer-request` or `viewer-response`, the function will be executed every time the
distribution behaviour event occurs.

:::info

If your function associations are handled by an external system such as Terraform or the CDK, the `associate` command is
not required, simply exclude this step from your CI/CD workflow.

:::

```shell
cf-functions associate
```

<video width={"100%"} controls>
    <source src="/cf-functions/video/associate-example.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

:::note

It can take up to 5 minutes for an associate command to complete, due to the fact that each CloudFront edge node needs
to be updated for the distribution status to return to `DEPLOYED`.

Use `cf-functions help` for more information on commands.
