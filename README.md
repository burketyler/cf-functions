This framework is designed to make using AWS CloudFront Functions easy. Its aim is to shield developers from
the complexity of the AWS API, letting them focus on the things that matter. Typescript is supported
out of the box and a number of useful types at your fingertips.

## Features

### ‚å®Ô∏è [Typescript](https://burketyler.github.io/cf-functions/docs/usage/typescript)

Typescript is enabled by default. No need to compile to Javascript, we got you covered.

### ü§ñ [Deployment](https://burketyler.github.io/cf-functions/docs/usage/deployment)

Modular CLI commands are provided for creating, testing and deploying functions. Using the commands it's a breeze to
automate your CI/CD workflow.

### üß™ [Testing](https://burketyler.github.io/cf-functions/docs/usage/testing)

No nasty surprises. Ensure quality releases by creating and maintaining a suite of tests associated with your CloudFront
Functions, using the built-in testing framework.

### ‚öôÔ∏è [Environment Variables](https://burketyler.github.io/cf-functions/docs/usage/environment-variables)

Under the hood, [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) is used to load environment configuration at runtime with zero
setup, simply create a `.env` file and plug in your variables.
